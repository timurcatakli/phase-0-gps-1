#This is my reflection
###This is my sub-heading

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

*I think I am pretty familiar with the git concepts we covered in week 1, it was working in a pair and connecting our work through GitHub that I was unfamiliar with.*

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

*I understand branches better after the session, including my local branches and pulling down changes to a project from a branch pushed by another person.*

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

*I asked my pair how to capture and save a screenshot for the assignment since I had never done this before.  Also some of the directions were a little confusing and I asked our guide to clarify.*

**What still confuses you about git?**

*I'm not sure there are things about git that confuse me at this point as much as I still don't know quite a bit about different commands and features of git.  I need to learn more to know what I don't know.*

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

*My partner and the guide were great.  Friendly and easy to work with.  My partner and I went back and forth explaining and understanding the work.  It was a bit frustrating for me only because I have never been a "team" person.  I have always excelled working on my own so this is a new experience I will need to get used to.*
